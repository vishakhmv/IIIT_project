# 🎭 Multimodal Emotion Recognition (Speech + Text Fusion)

## 📖 Description

This project implements a **Multimodal Emotion Recognition System** capable of predicting human emotions using **speech-only, text-only, and combined speech-text inputs**.  

The system classifies emotions into seven categories: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Pleasant Surprise, and Sad**.

The repository contains three independent deep learning pipelines:

- 🎙️ **Speech-Only Model** — learns emotional patterns from acoustic speech features such as tone, pitch, and prosody.
- 📝 **Text-Only Model** — analyzes emotional meaning from the semantic and contextual understanding of transcribed text.
- 🔀 **Multimodal Fusion Model** — combines both speech and text representations to achieve stronger and more robust emotion recognition.

The project also includes **representation learning analysis, t-SNE visualization, confusion matrices, and error analysis** to study the effectiveness of multimodal learning.

## 📊 Dataset

The models are trained and evaluated on the **TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)** dataset.

### Dataset Overview

- Consists of **2,800 speech samples** recorded by two actresses aged **26** and **64**.
- Balanced across **7 emotional categories**:
  - Angry
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Neutral
  - Pleasant Surprise
  - Sad

---

### Linguistic Structure

The dataset uses linguistically neutral carrier phrases such as:

> *“Say the word door”*  
> *“Say the word neat”*

All emotional categories contain the same spoken sentences, ensuring that emotional variation primarily comes from vocal expression rather than changes in textual content.

### Data Split

The dataset is divided using an **80% Training / 20% Testing** split while maintaining balanced emotion distributions during evaluation.
